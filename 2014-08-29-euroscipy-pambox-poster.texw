\begin{posterbox}[name=goals,column=0,row=0]{Goals}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collect published models of auditory processing.
    \item Simplify comparisons across models by standardizing the interface for
models that perform similar tasks.
    \item Make components reusable and easy to inspect and modify. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}
\end{posterbox}


\begin{posterbox}[name=problems,column=0,row=0,below=goals]{Problems and inspiration}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intelligibility prediction work often involves comparisons across models, but the source code is rarely available. Additionally,
reference levels and interfaces are often completely different.
    \item \texttt{scikit-learn}'s approach of providing a \emph{consistent} interface for all methods is a strong inspiration.
    \item The Auditory Modeling Toolbox \citep{amt} is a similar attempt at collecting published auditory models, made for Matlab. Although component are well tested, they are hard to reuse.
\end{itemize}

\begin{posterbox}[name=intelligibility,span=2,column=0,row=0,below=components]{Predicting speech intelligibility}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth-1em}
\vspace{1em}
Predicting speech intelligibility consists of predicting how well speech is understood in a given situation. Intelligibility experiments tend to have similar components, as illustrated below. 
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/experiment_structure.pdf}
        \captionof{figure}{Elements of a speech intelligibility prediction experiment.}
    \end{center}
\texttt{pambox} provides an interface to run experiments with an arbitrary number of models, SNRs, and distortion parameters. Currently, each experiment is treated as having a single speech material and a single ``distortion'', although that could be extended.

The preprocessing stage can easily be modified or replaced by overriding the \texttt{preprocessing} method of the \texttt{Experiment} class.
This allows, for example, to apply the level adjustments before the distortion, or to apply processing to both the target and the maskers.
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth-1em}
\vspace{1em}
Below is an example of a complete speech intelligibility prediction experiment. 
Two models are compared, in a condition with a speech-shaped noise masker.

\begin{posterbox}[name=discussion,column=2,below=development]{Conclusions}
\vspace{1em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{pambox} is still in its infancy. 
Very few auditory models are currently written in Python; it would require a considerable effort to reimplement existing models.
    \item However, implementation of models whose code was not released would be a great help.
    \item \texttt{pambox} needs contributions of models stages and complete models.
